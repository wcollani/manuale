# ManuaLE

manuale is a fully manual [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org)/[ACME](https://github.com/ietf-wg-acme/acme/) client for advanced users. It is intended to be used by a human in a manual workflow and contains no automation features whatsoever.

## Why?

Isn't the point of Let's Encrypt to be automatic and seamless? Maybe, but here's some reasons:

* You're not comfortable with an automatic process handling something as critical, or your complex infrastructure doesn't allow it in the first place.

* You already have perfect configuration management with something like Ansible. Renewing is a matter of dropping in a new certificate. With a manual client that works, it's literally a minute of work.

* You want the traditional and authentic SSL installation experience of copying files you don't understand to your server, searching for configuration instructions and praying that it works.

## Features

* Simple interface with no hoops to jump through. Keys and certificate signing requests are automatically generated: no more cryptic OpenSSL one-liners. (However, you do need to know what to do with generated certificates and keys yourself!)

* Support for DNS & HTTP validation. No need to figure out how to serve challenge files from a live domain.

* Obviously, runs without root access. Use it from any machine you want, it doesn't care. Internet connection recommended.

* Awful, undiscoverable name.

* And finally, if the `openssl` binary is your spirit animal after all, you can still bring your own keys and/or CSR's. Everybody wins.

## Installation

Python 3.3 or above is required.

### Using your package manager

* Arch Linux: in the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/manuale).

* Fedora Linux: `dnf install manuale`.

* [Gentoo Linux](https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/app-crypt/manuale).

* Package maintainers wanted: your package here?

### Using Docker

There is a Docker image on the [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/jgiannuzzi/letsencrypt-manuale/).

### Using pip

You can install the package from [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/manuale) using the `pip` tool. To do so, run `pip3 install manuale`.

If you're not using Windows or OS X pip may need to compile some of the dependencies. In this case, you need a compiler and development headers for Python, OpenSSL and libffi installed.

On Debian-based distributions, these will typically be `gcc python3-dev libssl-dev libffi-dev`, and on RPM-based distributions `gcc python3-devel openssl-devel libffi-devel`.

### From the git repository

    git clone https://github.com/veeti/manuale ~/.manuale
    cd ~/.manuale
    python3 -m venv env
    env/bin/python setup.py install
    ln -s env/bin/manuale ~/.bin/

(Assuming you have a `~/.bin/` directory in your `$PATH`).

## Quick start

Register an account (once):

    $ manuale register me@example.com

Authorize one or more domains:

    $ manuale authorize example.com
    DNS verification required. Make sure these records are in place:
      _acme-challenge.example.com. IN TXT "(some random gibberish)"
    Press Enter to continue.
    ...
    1 domain(s) authorized. Let's Encrypt!

Get your certificate:

    $ manuale issue --output certs/ example.com
    ...
    Certificate issued.

    Expires: 2016-06-01
     SHA256: (more random gibberish)

    Wrote key to certs/example.com.pem
    Wrote certificate to certs/example.com.crt
    Wrote certificate with intermediate to certs/example.com.chain.crt
    Wrote intermediate certificate to certs/example.com.intermediate.crt

Set yourself a reminder for renewal!

## Usage

You need to create an account once. To do so, call `manuale register [email]`. This will create a new account key for you. Follow the registration instructions.

Once that's done, you'll have your account saved in `account.json` in the current directory. You'll need this to do anything useful. Oh, and it contains your private key, so keep it safe and secure.

`manuale` expects the account file to be in your working directory by default, so you'll probably want to make a specific directory to do all your certificate stuff in. Likewise, created certificates get saved in the current path by default.

Next up, verify the domains you want a certificate for with `manuale authorize [domain]`. This will show you the DNS records you need to create and wait for you to do it. For example, you might do it for `example.com` and `www.example.com`. Optionally, you can use one of the supported DNS providers to automatically create the challenger records. `--dns-provider {route53,azure,none}`

Once that's done, you can finally get down to business. Run `manuale issue example.com www.example.com` to get your certificate. It'll save the key, certificate and certificate with intermediate to the working directory.

There's plenty of documentation inside each command. Run `manuale -h` for a list of commands and `manuale [command] -h` for details.
